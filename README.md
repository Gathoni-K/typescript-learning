**Anime watchlist**
-Is basically a To-do app but for anime.
-Users are able to search for whatever anime they like and then it is added to their watchlist,
they can also mark anime as completed or delete them.


Tech Stack: React, TS and CSS.

Features implemented:
1.Add feature.
2.Delete and mark as completed features.
3.Fetching data from an API.


This is an unfinished app, I am yet to implement the mark as completed functionality, and
adding individual items, the UI is fine, logic a bit shaky.
