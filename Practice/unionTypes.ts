/*
-This syntax of 'type' declaration is mostly used when: 
1.some properties are always required.
2. one has to choose from a set of additional property combinations, the brackets ensure that
the intersection between the base and the entire union.
Syntax:
type = typeName = baseProperties & (unionOption1 | unionOption2)
//baseProperties - are the non-negotiable ones, that are always required
    {property1: type, property2: type}
//unionOptions -
    ({option1: type} | {option2: type}) 

-the brackets in our code ensure for correct grouping, i.e. our base properties AND one of the union types.
-This shows how TS can enforce an exclusive choice, must pick one option instead of optional parameters
