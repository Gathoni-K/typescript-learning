**BUILDING A CRUD APP IN REACT AND TS.**

CRUD:
-Create, Read, Update and Delete.

-Our app will help us add, delete, read and update our tasks.
-Our app will be using local storage.

-Our app will use icons, so in our terminal, write 'npm install react-icons'
-Move to the 'package.json' file under "dependencies" to confirm that they are present.
-Create separate folders: one form components and the other for CSS.
-Create a 'todo.ts' file in our 'src' folder where we will store all our types.
-Create a module file that will handle all our 'CRUD' operations.


-Shortcut for creating and exporting a component is 'rfca'.
-For our handler functions, we are using a different syntax which is :  
    const functionName = () => {
        //do something
    }
-The above method is the most preffered and commonly used method.


-Whenever we are listing or entering list items, we need to give each a unique key prop.
